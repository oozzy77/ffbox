Work in progress.

**A better docker for deploying LLM or large AI model apps.** With our container fast streaming technology, you get instant inference, nearly 0 cold start time for your deployed LLM app.

Deploy your python AI app to cloud by just pushing your code to s3, and run it with a single command.

### Usage

Push local python project to s3 bucket

`ffbox push "s3://my-bucket/flux_image_gen"`

Pull s3 bucket to local directory

`ffbox pull "s3://my-bucket/flux_image_gen"`

### Example S3 bucket public read policy
