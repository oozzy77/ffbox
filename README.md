Work in progress.

**A better docker for deploying LLM or large AI model apps.** With our container fast streaming technology, you get instant inference, nearly 0 cold start time for your deployed LLM app

Deploy your python AI app to cloud by just pushing your code to s3, and run it with a single command.

### Usage

Push local python project to s3 bucket

`cd my_python_project`

`ffbox push "s3://my_bucket/my_python_project"`

Pull s3 bucket to local directory

`ffbox pull "s3://my-bucket/flux_image_gen"`

Run python project

`ffbox run "s3://my-bucket/flux_image_gen"`

### Benchmarks

no cache in ffbox_cache/ cold start - Pillow image processing:

`ffbox run "s3://ff-image-gen/sd3"` - 11s

### Example S3 bucket public read policy
